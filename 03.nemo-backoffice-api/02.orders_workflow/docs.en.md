The Nemo.travel system implements the capabilities of a standard back-office and allows you to:

- Work with orders via the web interface (search, view, modification).
- Conducting payment by the order through various methods.
- Creating reports and ordering documents.
- Statistics and analytics.
- Automatic integration with third-party back office.

If required, all bookings made in the Nemo Connect system can be automatically uploaded to the Nemo.travel Back office. But there are additional requests which allow to manage processes manually.
